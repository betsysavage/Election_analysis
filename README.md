# Election_analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
## Purpose
Tom, our client for this project, is an employee of the Colorado Board of Elections. He has requested assistance to write an algorithm that will automatically analyze local election results. The goal of this project is to 1.) confirm the voting results of the election and 2.) create a script that can be scaled beyond this single election to other congressional and senate district election results. In order to successfully certify the election results, the script was written to produce the following the following necessary information: 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county
7. Generate the percentage of votes each county contributes to the total number of votes in the precinct
8. Determine the county with the highest voter turnout.

## Election Audit Results
The analysis of the election show that:
- **There were 369,711 total votes cast in the local election**.
The total vote count was calculated by looping through the rows and continuing to add the number of votes in each row to the total value. First, I created a "total_votes" variable and initialized it to start at zero.

After setting up a for loop, I included a section of code that would read the value of the votes from the dictionary representing the row.

To produce the number of total votes in an output table, I included the "total_votes" value (that had been calculated in the for loop) in a series of f strings that produced the table format and contents.

- The following table breaks down the **total number of votes cast in each county, as well as their percentage of the total votes in the election**.

I then created a series of f strings to produce an output table. Because this code is within the for loop, the output of results is repeated for each county.

- From the above analysis, we can see that **the county with the largest number of votes was Denver**, with a total vote count of 306,055, which was 82.8% of the total ballots cast across the precinct. To confirm this result, I included a piece of code that would automatically produce the county with the largest county turnout.
[CODE DESCRIPTION]

- **The candidates included the following names**:

  -Charles Casper Stockham
  
  -Diana DeGette
  
  -Raymon Anthony Doane
  
This list was generated by looping through each candidate name in the dictionary of rows and adding any candidate name that was new to the list. If the csv file were to be modified to add a row with another candidate name, the for loop would pick up this new name and add it to the list.
 
 -The following table breaks down the total vote count and percentage of votes for each candidate:

 - From the above analysis, we can see that **the candidate with the largest number of votes was Diana DeGette**, who secured a sizeable 73.8% of the votes. To confirm this result, a piece of code is included in the analysis to produce a table that displays the winner's count and percentage of results. When run, the data in this table is indeed Diana's. To create this piece of code...

## Election Audit Summary

The python script as described above can be considered scalable for other elections. The text file that displays the results will automatically update to display the candidate names, county names, and votes, even if they are different values than the ones used in our sample csv.
