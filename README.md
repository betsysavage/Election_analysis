# Election_analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
3. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.13

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the local election.
[CODE DESCRIPTION]
- The following table breaks down the total number of votes cast in each county, as well as their percentage of the total votes in the election.

- From the above analysis, we can see that the county with the largest number of votes was Denver, with a total vote count of 306,055, which was 82.8% of the total ballots cast across the precinct. To confirm this result, I included a piece of code that would automatically produce the county with the largest county turnout.
[CODE DESCRIPTION]

- The candidates were:
  -Candidate 1
  -Candidate 2
  -Candidate 3
 -The candidate results were:
  - Candidate 1 received "x% of the vote and "y" number of votes
  - Candidate 2 received "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes
  - Candidate 3 received "x% of the vote and "y" number of votes
 -The winner of the election was:
  - Candidate (1, 2, or 3), who received "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes
